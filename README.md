# Music_Store_Analysis_SQL

In this project I've taken data from music store to analyse and solve their queries. I use data of different csv files related to music store containing diffenrent records. Tables are Artist, Album, Track, Media_Type, Genre, Playlist_Track, Playlist, Invoice_line, Invoice, Customer, Employee, etc. They are interconnected as shown in schemas. Solving the questions related to the music store in postgreSQL is fun and littlebit challenging also.

Thanks!
